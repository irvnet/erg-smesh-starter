# What Problems Are we Solving?
## (Key Use Cases for Service Mesh...)

---

## Load balancing

service mesh can distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of a service, ensuring that no single instance becomes overloaded. This can improve the performance and reliability of the system.

---

## Traffic routing

A service mesh can be used to route traffic between microservices in a variety of ways, including by service version, user, or geographic region. This allows organizations to deploy and test new versions of services without affecting the entire system.

---

## Service discovery

A service mesh can help microservices discover and communicate with one another, even if they are running on different servers or in different data centers. This can make it easier to build and manage large, distributed systems.

---

## Security

A service mesh can be configured to enforce security policies such as encryption, authentication, and access control. This can help to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to critical systems.

---

## Monitoring and observability

A service mesh can provide detailed visibility into the traffic flowing between microservices, making it easier to monitor performance and identify issues. This can help organizations to quickly detect and resolve problems, improving the overall reliability of the system.

---

# Conclusion

A service mesh can be a powerful tool for managing and optimizing the communication between microservices in a distributed system. By providing load balancing, traffic routing, service discovery, security, and observability capabilities, it can help organizations to build, deploy, and maintain complex, scalable systems more efficiently.
