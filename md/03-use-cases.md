# What Problems Are we Solving?
## (Key Use Cases for Service Mesh...)

---

## Load balancing

- Distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of a service
- ensure individual instances aren't overwhelmed
- improve system performance and reliability by managing requests

---

## Traffic routing

- route traffic between microservices in a variety of ways
- manage traffic by service version, by user, or geographic region as examples 
- allows for testing new service versions with a subset of traffic without affecting the entire system

---

## Service discovery

- can help microservices discover and communicate (even across network boundaries)
- can simplify building large systems or managing ephemeral resources

---

## Security

- can help enforce security policies such as encryption, authentication, and access control
- This can help to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to critical systems
- can simplify effort levels to adopt security on registered services 

---

## Monitoring and observability

- can provide visibility into traffic flowing between services
- simplifies monitoring performance to quickly detect and resolve problems
- better/simplier observability helps improve overall reliability of the system.

## What might I use service mesh for?
- bridging the gap between cloud services and on-prem serivces
- bridging the gap across multiple clouds
- managing east-west traffic within (or across) a k8s cluster(s)
- managing east-west traffic across a datacenter
- managing east-west traffic across multiple

# Conclusion

A service mesh can be a powerful tool for managing and optimizing the communication between microservices in a distributed system. By providing load balancing, traffic routing, service discovery, security, and observability capabilities, it can help organizations to build, deploy, and maintain complex, scalable systems more efficiently.
